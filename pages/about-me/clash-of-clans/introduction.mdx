From my Childhood, I really loved playing games, mainly video games, Clash of clans
is one of my all time favorite.

I have been playing clash of clans since 2013, and i stared my web development journey somewhere around 2014. I most of the time used to play clash of clans while learning web development.

One day i thought why not make a website for my clan, so i started working on it, and i made a really small website of my clan, it was a static website, and i used to update it manually, and it was a really small website, it was just a page with some information about my clan.

So I stared digging the internet for some tutorials, and i found a tutorial on how to make a dynamic website, and i followed some tutorials, started learing php to create a dynamic site. I found it really powerful to create dynamic website. Then I stared working on creating a website of all the clans and players in the game, that way, i started to learn more about web development.
