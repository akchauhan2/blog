This website is the outcome of my intial curosity of creating a clans page. Visit [akchauhan2](https://akchauhan2.com/) to see the website in action. The website is created using simple php and very basic html and css. Also bootstrap 4 and Clash of clans API.

I am really thankful to supercell for providing the API for developers to use for good.
